    Redesigning signup
  </h3>

  <p class="page-body-copy">
    In Spring 2021, Mural was growing quickly. The pandemic had accellerated remote work and all of a sudden everyone needed a digital whiteboard to keep collaboration flowing on their newly distributed teams. The moment called for something big. Internally, we began working toward what we called "lightning strike" moments - big upcoming releases to wow our users and announce ourselves as first-class tool in the newly coined category of Collaborative Intelligence. 
    
    In my corner of the product - Growth and Acquisition - this meant managing the bridge between marketing and the users' first product experience. Specifically, we needed to iterate on the existing signup flow to align with a company-wide brand & product refresh, with a focus on delightful moments.
  </p>
  <h4 class="page-body-interior-subhead">
    The problem
  </h4>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/mural-site.gif" class="mural-site" alt="The Mural website is colorful, full of life and movement" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">The Mural website is colorful, full of life and movement...</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/mural-signup-before.png" class="mural-signup-before" alt="The next step in the flow: a relatively lifeless signup experience" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">...contrasted with the next step in the flow: a relatively lifeless signup experience</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    Put bluntly, the signup flow simply didn't live up to the promise of the marketing website. Where was the collaboration, the movement, the color? It almost felt like a different company.

    It wasn't just the first step either. The entire flow followed the same lifeless theme:
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/mural-signup-flow-before.png" class="mural-signup-flow-before" alt="The whole signup flow looking grey and bland" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">The greyness will continue until morale improves.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h4 class="page-body-interior-subhead">
    The approach
  </h4>
  <figure class="figure-pullout">
    <img src="img/mural/compositions.png" class="mural-compositions" alt="Sketches of potential compositions of the signup form" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">Composition studies
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    So how to we break this down and begin to move forward? First, we needed to decide what the voice and tone of this flow was going to be. There was some high-level guidance from the brand team, but we needed to decide what aspects of that to dial up for the signup moment specifically. Running some casual brainstorming, we aligned on a tonal direction.

    We also had some previous attempts that hadn't seent he light of day to reference:
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/new-direction.png" class="mural-new-direction" alt="Sticky notes with voice and tone options" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">Working on voice and tone, and learning from previous efforts</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    From this initial exploration, a visual metaphor started to emerge. Signup should feel like an invitation. Come in. Sit down. Stay awhile.
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/chairs.png" class="mural-chairs" alt="Layout options with chairs as a visual device" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">A visual metaphor started to emerge</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    Next, we needed to finalize the visual hierarchy. In our case, grounding the illustration at the bottom of the viewport made conceptual sense with the chair metaphor, and allowed for easy adaptation to a single-column mobile layout.
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/chairs-hierarchy.png" class="mural-chairs-hierarchy" alt="Final layout with form centered and chairs at the bottom" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">Grounding the illustration makes conceptual sense, and centers the form as the hero</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    With the visual design taking shape, it was time to fine-tune the copy with our Content Design team. Copy is as crucial to the success of the final solution as visual design. In fact, probably more so.
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/chairs-copy.png" class="mural-chairs-copy" alt="Working on the copy for the signup flow" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">Nailing the copy is as important as nailing the visual design. Probably moreso.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    I ended up leaving Mural before the full re-brand shipped, including this work, so I can't say for sure how it performed compared to the previous flow, but I'm proud of the final product and think it looks great in production today. It pays off the promise of the brand and marketing website, and continues the journey into the product in a way that keeps the user engaged and curious.

  <h4 class="page-body-interior-subhead">
    Component 2: Top bar
  </h4>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    My attention shifted next to the top area of the dashboard interface. There's a top stripe with the Title aligned left and an Invite/Share button, search, and question mark icon aligned right. Beneath that, there's a grey bar that houses a room description and filtering options.
  </p>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    When in a room, there's a caret to the right of the room name which shows some options that can be taken on the room, and a 'person' icon to the right showing how many people have been invited to the room.
  </p>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    My reaction to this was that things might be grouped more contextually. The room description, or "purpose" should be visually paired with the title, and search and filtering functions should live together as well, rather than search by itself up top.
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/current-top-bar.png" class="mural-img" alt="Current MURAL top bar" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">The top bar works well enough, but could make better use of space and group elements more contextually.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    I also wondered if, rather than writing "Created by John Doe" next to the title, we might be able to represent the room creator visually.
  </p>
  <h4 class="page-body-interior-subhead">
    Component 3: Main canvas
  </h4>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    In the main body of the dashboard view we see our murals organized as tiles. On my laptop, the tiles were 4-up, with one fo the four on the top row occupied by the "create a new mural" tile/button.
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-pullout">
    <img src="img/mural/mural-tooltip.gif" class="mural-img" alt="tooltip behavior" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption"></figcaption>

  <figure class="figure-pullout">
    <img src="img/mural/mural-tooltip-2.gif" class="mural-img" alt="tooltip behavior" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">Inconsistent tooltip behavior</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    My immediate reaction was that it would be interesting to explore the trade-offs of showing the preview tiles larger, at the expense of seeing fewer on screen at one time. As I interacted with the tiles, it made me further wish for more space, not only to show more of a visual preview of the mural board, but to have more room for text and information. The preview function there now feels inconsistent with other info tooltips.
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/current-main-canvas.png" class="mural-img" alt="Current MURAL top bar" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">The top bar works well enough, but could make better use of space and group elements more contextually.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    In addition, while I see the merit in styling the create new mural button like the murals, I feel like it's getting lost somewhat because it blends in so well. I wondered about the tradeoffs of dedicating the entire space to mural tiles.
  </p>
  <h3 class="page-body-subhead">
    Part 2 - Design Proposal
  </h3>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    In part 2 of the exercise, we'll design a new version of the dashboard to include some insight into team activity on murals and rooms, with the goal of increasing weekly engagement, and while we're at it, why not try and address some of the potential improvements from part 1.
  </p>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    I first needed to work out where in the layout an activity feed would make the most sense. Rather than hide the activity away, to be shown on a click or some other interaction, I decided to display a feed of team activity by default that could be hidden away if users were doing heads-down work or simply didn't want to see it at any time.
  </p>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    My sense was that a horizontal layout would make it difficult to read through, so I was down to two vertical layout options for the feed - one on the left side of the murals and the other on the right. I decided to try the feed on the right so that it wouldn't compete with the main navigation sidebar.
  </p>
  <figure class="figure-inline">
    <img src="img/mural/news-feed-placement.png" class="news-feed-img" alt="Placement options for a team activity feed" />
    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">I decided on a vertical layout for the team activity feed, placed on the opposite side of the main navigation sidebar.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    Based on what I know about how teams work together on Mural, I next to document which team activities a user might find value in knowing. To answer the brief, I need to focus on surfacing relevant activity on murals and rooms, and ultimately decided a user should be notified when a teammate:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Creates a new open room
    <br/>
    • Creates a new mural in a room you belong to
    <br/>
    • Leaves comments on a mural you belong to
    <br/>
    • Responds to your comment
    <br/>
    • Invites you to a workspace, room or mural
    <br/>
    • Invites someone else to a room or mural you belong to
    <br/>
    • Archives, moves, renames or deletes a room or mural you belong to
  </p>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    It also occurred to me that a feed including all those activity types might become too noisy for some, or might contain a lot of information they may not be interested in. I made a note to try a solution with some abilty to configure the type of news that would appear in the feed.
  </p>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    One approach to satisfy the business goal of increased weekly engagement is to send out an emailed digest of activity, perhaps defaulted to once weekly. If users know there are conversations waiting for them or invitations to accept, it would be a strong incentive to open the app and complete those tasks.
