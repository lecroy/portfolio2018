    ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Taylor LeCroy here, but you can call me Taylor. You may know me from the Design world, but thereâ€™s more to me than just clever solutions and elegant yet intuitive design. Letâ€™s dive in.
  </p>

  <h4 class="about-interior-subhead">
    Off-Duty Adventures
  </h4>
  <ul class="page-body-list">
    <li><span>Hells Angels Wannabe:</span> I ride motorcycles like I design products - with a dash of  instinct, just enough emphasis on speed, and a whole lot of careful steering.
    </li>
    <li><span>Amateur Astronomer:</span> Iâ€™ve always been a stargazer. Itâ€™s like market research but for giant orbs of dust and gas.</li>
    <li><span>Struggling musician:</span> While I enjoy a good strum to unwind, if the walls of my basement could talk, theyâ€™d tell me not to quit my day job.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="about-interior-subhead">
    Leisure Time
  </h4>
  <ul class="page-body-list">
    <li><span>Bookworm:</span> If I donâ€™t give up on a book around the 25% mark, you can bet itâ€™s a classic.
    </li>
    <li><span>Trailblazer:</span> I live right next to a beautiful mountain trail. Iâ€™ve done some of my best design work there, far from any notepad or computer screen.</li>
    <li><span>Go Gators:</span> I was brought up to believe college football is almost as important as using data to inform design decisions. And I'm calling it now: by the next time I update this website, my Gators will be decent again.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="about-interior-subhead">
    Secret Talents
  </h4>
  <ul class="page-body-list">
    <li><span>Scrabble Junkie:</span> Word games have always come easily to me. I once started an Instagram account just to share strategy and tips.
    </li>
    <li><span>Master Chef:</span> Making a recipe come together is a lot like product design. You need to include the right ingredients, blend them to create perfect chemistry, and do a whole lot of taste-testing.</li>
    <li><span>Handyman:</span> Maintenance on a house never ends, just like software development. Itâ€™s all about keeping an organized backlog and ruthlessly prioritizing the right improvements.</li>
  </ul>

    Working with me
  </h4>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    My approach to work is grounded in authenticity. It's about being genuinely myself in every interaction, combining professionalism with personal character. This balance leads to better and more effective collaborations, as people sense and appreciate authenticity. I believe that our work is an extension of who we are, reflecting our beliefs and the impact we want to make. Daily growth in all life areas contributes to our overall success, both personally and professionally.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    My work ethic revolves around sustainable intensity, prioritizing health in all aspects â€“ mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual. This holistic well-being is essential for peak performance. I incorporate practices like meditation, reading, exercise, and quality time with loved ones to maintain this balance. In meetings, I value humor and fun, seeing them as catalysts for productivity and enjoyment. My feedback style is direct and detailed, aiming to build trust and empowerment. In leadership, I emphasize health, authenticity, extreme ownership, autonomy, and continuous growth, fostering a culture of accountability and relentless pursuit of personal and professional development.
