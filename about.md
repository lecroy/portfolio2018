    ðŸ‘‹ Taylor LeCroy here, but you can call me Taylor. You may know me from the Design world, but thereâ€™s more to me than just clever, elegant, intuitive, ground-breaking...you get the point. Letâ€™s dive in.
  </p>

  <h4 class="about-interior-subhead">
    Off-Duty Adventures
  </h4>
  <ul class="page-body-list">
    <li><span>Hells Angel Wannabe:</span> I ride motorcycles like I design - with a dash of instinct, just enough speed, and a whole lot of careful steering.
    </li>
    <li><span>Amateur Astronomer:</span> Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with what's out there beyond our brilliant blue home. Itâ€™s like an exploratory research phase, but for unfathomably giant orbs of exploding dust and gasses.</li>
    <li><span>Struggling musician:</span> I love breaking a complex song down into manageable pieces. Getting a little better with practice, but I'm pretty sure if my walls could talk theyâ€™d tell me to stick to product design for now.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="about-interior-subhead">
    Leisure Time
  </h4>
  <ul class="page-body-list">
    <li><span>Bookworm:</span> I prefer long-form reading to social media. Although in books, just as in product design, sometimes it's best to bail part way through and start something something from scratch.
    </li>
    <li><span>Trailblazer:</span> I live right next to a beautiful mountain trail and tend to do some of my best design work there, miles from any notepad or computer screen.</li>
    <li><span>Go Gators:</span> I was brought up to believe college football is almost as important as using data to inform design decisions. Calling it now: by the next time I update this website, my Gators will be decent again.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="about-interior-subhead">
    Secret Talents
  </h4>
  <ul class="page-body-list">
    <li><span>Scrabble Junkie:</span> Word games have always come easily to me. I once started an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scrabble_snacks" target="_blank">Instagram account</a> just to talk through my moves and share strategy and tips.
    </li>
    <li><span>Master Chef:</span> Making a recipe come together isn't so dissimilar from product design - you need to include the right ingredients, blend them to create perfect chemistry, and do plenty of taste-testing.</li>
    <li><span>Handyman:</span> Maintenance on a house never ends. Thankfully I've got plenty of experience keeping an organized backlog and ruthlessly prioritizing the most impactful improvements.</li>
  </ul>

    Working with me
  </h4>
  <p class="page-body-copy">
    My approach to work is grounded in authenticity. It's about being genuinely myself in every interaction, combining professionalism with personal character. This balance leads to better and more effective collaborations, as people sense and appreciate authenticity. I believe our work is an extension of who we are, reflecting our beliefs and the impact we want to make. Daily growth in all life areas contributes to our overall success, both personally and professionally.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My work ethic revolves around sustainable intensity, prioritizing health in all aspects â€“ mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual. This holistic well-being is essential for peak performance. I incorporate practices like meditation, reading, connection with nature, and quality time with family to maintain this balance. In meetings, I value humor and fun. The best input and ideas come from people who are relaxed and riffing, not stressed or just there because they're obligated to attend. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My feedback style is direct and detailed, aiming to build trust by demonstrating thoughtfulness and commitment. In leadership, I emphasize health, authenticity, extreme ownership, autonomy, and continuous growth, fostering a culture of accountability and relentless pursuit of personal and professional development.
